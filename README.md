## How to install

Download this repo and place the EFI folder into your internal drive's EFI partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS Big Sur

There are two ways you can make a USB installer:

1. Have a working install of macOS, download the Installer from the App Store, then make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume`

2. If you are using Windows, use [macrecovery.py](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html) from the offical OpenCore release package.

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the installer drive and install as usual (GUID Partiton Map; APFS). After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

## Generating your own serial and Editing ROM

Use GenSMBIOS (https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a serial for MacBookPro13,3

use PlistEdit Pro or any decent plist editor to manually enter the details in the following sections of the config (as shown in the video): (SystemSerialNumber, MLB, and UUID)

You should also put in your ethernet adapter's MAC address into the ROM section.
