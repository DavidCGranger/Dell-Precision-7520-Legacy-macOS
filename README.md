## How to install

Download this repo and place the EFI folder into your internal drive's EFI partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS High Sierra

1. Have a working install of macOS, [download](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12) the Installer using the App Store, then make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ High\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/NameOfTheUSB`

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the installer drive and install as usual (GUID Partiton Map; APFS). After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

## Generating your own serial and Editing ROM

Use GenSMBIOS (https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a serial for MacBookPro13,3 (Skylake) or 14,3 (Kaby Lake)

use Xcode, ProperTree or any decent plist editor to manually enter the details in the following sections of the config (as shown in the video): (SystemSerialNumber, MLB, and UUID)

You should also put in your ethernet adapter's MAC address into the ROM section.
