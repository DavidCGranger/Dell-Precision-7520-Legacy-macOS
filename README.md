## How to install

Download this repo and place the EFI folder into your internal drive's EFI partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS Ventura Beta

1. Have a working install of macOS, [download](https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-ventura-13-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/) the full installer package, install it to get the installer app, then make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura\ beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/NameOfTheUSB`

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the installer drive and install as usual (GUID Partiton Map; APFS). After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

## Disabling CFG-Lock

In order for macOS to boot at all, you'll need to disable CFG-Lock.
To do that, boot the EFI, press Space and select modGRUBShell.efi

From there type this command: setup_var 0x4ED 0x00

To confirm CFG-Lock has been disabled, boot back into OpenCore and ControlMsrE2.efi and verify the firmware has an unlocked register present

## Generating your own serial and Editing ROM

Use GenSMBIOS (https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a serial for MacBookPro13,3

use Xcode, ProperTree or any decent plist editor to manually enter the details in the following sections of the config (as shown in the video): (SystemSerialNumber, MLB, and UUID)

You should also put in your ethernet adapter's MAC address into the ROM section.
